  <h2> Introduction</h2>
       <p> I'm a full-time <b><font color="goldenrod">family man</font></b> and part-time <b>musician</b>, <b>cyclist</b>, <b>photographer</b>, <b>artist</b>, <b>learner</b> and <b>adventurer</b>. I have resided in New Zealand for over a year now. I've been working as a <small>salesperson</small> for the better part of my short life and now I believe it's time to focus my energy on something much more <strong><font color="chartruese">awesome!</font></strong></p> 
    
      <p>Technology as a creative medium is something I'm eager to explore and understand. By the end of my front-end career course I plan on taking what I learned and apply it towards that goal.</p>
